Files:

 - README: this file
 - BOS_CUN_trips1M.csv.gz, a gzipped CSV file with about 1M trip records collected for a particular route
 - trips.pmm: a YAML-formatted metadata file that describes most of the columns in the CSV file.

Background:

Hopper receives several billion priced air travel trips every day, in near real-time.
Each trip is part of a bundle of trips indicated by a message identifier.
Usually a bundle of trips is the result of a consumer flight search at an online travel agency (OTA).
For example, a user might search for flights from BOS to JFK, perhaps including nearby airports,
with particular (possibly flexible) departure and return dates.
The search returns many possible priced trip options, which forms a bundle of trips.
Hopper doesn't receive any information about whether a trip was purchased,
what the original query was, or any user-identifiable information.

This exercise includes all the trips we received for a single route over a period of about 60 days.
Feel free to use whatever tools you like, and sketch a short (<500 words) consumer-oriented article
with tips for flying from Boston to Cancun.  Choose your own focus, perhaps considering things like:

    - When should I travel?
    - How far ahead should I book?
    - What price should I expect to pay?
    - Should I buy my ticket now or wait?

We're interested as much in your process as in the final product,
so don't feel you have to dot every i and cross every t.
